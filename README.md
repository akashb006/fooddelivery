# fooddelivery
Our food delivery web application is a comprehensive platform built with React for the frontend, Spring Boot for the backend, and MySQL for the database. The application allows users to browse and order food from various restaurants, making the process of food delivery convenient and efficient. 

The React frontend provides a seamless and intuitive user interface, allowing customers to search for restaurants, view menus, add items to their cart, and place orders. It offers features like filtering options, user authentication, and order tracking.

On the backend, Spring Boot handles the server-side logic, including managing restaurant data, processing orders, and handling payment transactions. It provides a robust and scalable foundation for the application, ensuring high performance and reliability.

MySQL is used as the database management system to store and retrieve data efficiently. It stores information such as restaurant details, menu items, user profiles, and order history.

By combining the power of React, Spring Boot, and MySQL, our food delivery web application delivers a seamless and user-friendly experience for customers, while providing restaurants with a streamlined platform to manage their orders and offerings.
